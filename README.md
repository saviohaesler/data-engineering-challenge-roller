Hello to the Data Engineering Fundamentals Challenge.

To set everything up to work, you need to do the following:
    - Start InfluxDB by typing ‘influxd’ into the terminal
    - Start the server script by writing ‘cd def2/scripts/’ and 'python server.py' in the terminal
    - And finally start the generator by writing ‘cd def2/scripts/’ and 'python generator.py' in the terminal

Now you can analyse the data in the InfluxDB under ‘http://your-ip:8086/’
